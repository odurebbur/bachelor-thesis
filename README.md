# PX4/Gazebo Mission Execution and Path-Deviation Analysis

## Overview

This project is intended for running repeatable drone missions in simulation and analyzing deviation from a planned route using PX4 flight logs.

The top-level project structure is:

- **bachelor-thesis/**: main project repository
- **PX4-Autopilot/**: PX4 source tree and simulator code
- **Missions/**: mission plans, logs, CSV exports, analysis scripts, and experiment folders

The software stack consists of:

- **PX4**: autopilot
- **Gazebo**: simulator
- **ROS 2**: middleware for optional topic bridging and data collection
- **QGroundControl**: mission planning and mission execution interface

The main objective is to:

1. create a repeatable mission,
2. execute it in simulation,
3. save the PX4 flight log,
4. convert the log to CSV,
5. compute path-deviation metrics in Python,
6. aggregate repeated runs within a condition,
7. compare multiple experimental groups.

---

## Git Tracking Rules

The repository is set up so that:

- `.ulg` files can be committed
- `.csv` files are ignored through `.gitignore`

This keeps the repository smaller while preserving the main raw PX4 flight logs.

---

## Mission Definition

A **QGroundControl `.plan` file** was created for a simple rectangular mission.

Mission shape:

- takeoff
- fly a **20 m × 20 m rectangle**
- return to launch area
- land

This shape is useful because it is:

- repeatable,
- easy to visualize,
- easy to compare across runs,
- suitable for measuring path deviation, especially around corners.

---

## Running the Full Simulation Stack

This setup is normally launched using multiple terminals.

### Terminal 1: Start PX4 and Gazebo

Run from inside `PX4-Autopilot/`:

```bash
cd ~/bachelor-thesis/PX4-Autopilot
make px4_sitl gz_x500_depth
```

This launches:

- PX4 SITL
- Gazebo simulation
- the `x500_depth` drone model

### Terminal 2: Start ROS 2 environment

Load ROS 2:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```

If needed, verify ROS 2 is available:

```bash
ros2 topic list
```

### Terminal 3: Start the Gazebo-to-ROS bridge

Run:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /clock@rosgraph_msgs/msg/Clock[gz.msgs.Clock
```

This bridges Gazebo simulation time into ROS 2 as `/clock`.

### Terminal 4: Open QGroundControl

Launch QGroundControl separately, for example:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
./QGroundControl.AppImage
```

QGroundControl is used for:

- loading the mission plan
- uploading the mission to PX4
- arming the vehicle
- switching to Mission mode
- downloading `.ulg` flight logs after the run

### Optional Terminal 5: Record ROS 2 data

To record ROS 2 topics during a run:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 bag record /clock -o baseline_run_01
```

Stop the recording with `Ctrl+C` after the flight finishes.

---

## Mission Execution

### 1. Start PX4 and Gazebo

Run from inside `PX4-Autopilot/`:

```bash
cd ~/bachelor-thesis/PX4-Autopilot
make px4_sitl gz_x500_depth
```

### 2. Open QGroundControl

Launch QGroundControl separately.

### 3. Upload the mission

In QGroundControl:

1. open **Plan**
2. load `~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/px4_rectangle_mission.plan`
3. click **Upload**

### 4. Execute the mission

In QGroundControl:

1. return to **Fly**
2. **Arm** the vehicle
3. switch to **Mission** mode

PX4 then executes the uploaded rectangular mission in Gazebo.

---

## Flight Log Collection

PX4 automatically logs each armed flight.

After the mission:

1. open **QGroundControl**
2. go to **Analyze**
3. open **Log Download**
4. download the latest `.ulg` file
5. save it inside the run folder, for example:

```text
bachelor-thesis/Missions/baseline/run_01/run_01_baseline.ulg
```

The `.ulg` file is the PX4 flight log used for later analysis.

---

## Python Environment for Log Conversion

Ubuntu 24.04 blocks direct `pip --user` installation into the system-managed Python environment, so a virtual environment is used.

### 1. Install required packages

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-pip
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/venvs/ulog
```

### 3. Activate it

```bash
source ~/venvs/ulog/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install `pyulog`

```bash
pip install pyulog
```

---

## Converting `.ulg` to CSV

Example workflow for the first baseline run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/baseline/run_01
cd ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/baseline/run_01
ulog2csv ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/baseline/run_01/run_01_baseline.ulg
```

This exports the PX4 log into multiple CSV files inside the same run folder.

---

## Important Exported CSV Files

The most useful CSV files for path-deviation analysis are:

- `vehicle_local_position_0.csv`  
  PX4 estimated local position

- `vehicle_local_position_groundtruth_0.csv`  
  simulator ground-truth local position

- `vehicle_status_0.csv`  
  vehicle state / flight mode information

- `mission_result_0.csv`  
  mission completion information

Optional supporting files:

- `vehicle_global_position_0.csv`
- `vehicle_global_position_groundtruth_0.csv`
- `sensor_gps_0.csv`
- `estimator_gps_status_0.csv`

---

## Why Local Position Is Used

The exported local-position CSV contains fields such as:

- `timestamp`
- `x`
- `y`
- `z`

These are easier to use than latitude/longitude because:

- values are already in meters,
- distance calculations are straightforward,
- waypoint-path comparisons are simpler.

The local frame in the log does not necessarily start at `(0, 0)`, so the trajectory is shifted so that the first recorded point becomes the origin before comparing it to the planned mission.

---

## Planned Path Used in Analysis

The mission path used in Python analysis is:

- `(0, 0)`
- `(20, 0)`
- `(20, 20)`
- `(0, 20)`
- `(0, 0)`

This represents the rectangular mission in local XY coordinates.

---

## Path-Deviation Metrics

The following metrics are used:

### Mean Cross-Track Error (CTE)

Average distance between the flown path and the planned path.

### Max Cross-Track Error

Largest path deviation at any point in the flight.

### RMS Cross-Track Error

Root-mean-square path deviation, which penalizes larger deviations more strongly.

These metrics are appropriate for comparing baseline and anomaly-condition runs.

---

## Script 1: Estimated Path vs Planned Path

File:

```text
Missions/scripts/analyze_estimated_vs_planned.py
```

### Purpose

This script:

- loads `vehicle_local_position_0.csv`
- reads `timestamp`, `x`, and `y`
- shifts the trajectory so the first point is `(0, 0)`
- compares the estimated path against the planned rectangle
- computes:
  - mean cross-track error
  - max cross-track error
  - RMS cross-track error
- saves:
  - `run_name_metrics_summary.csv`
  - `run_name_cte_timeseries.csv`
  - `run_name_estimated_vs_planned.png`
  - `run_name_cte_over_time.png`

### Run it

```bash
python3 ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/scripts/analyze_estimated_vs_planned.py   ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/baseline/run_01
```

### Baseline Result Example

For the first baseline run, this script produced:

- **Mean cross-track error:** `0.111 m`
- **Max cross-track error:** `0.621 m`
- **RMS cross-track error:** `0.199 m`

This serves as a baseline reference for later comparisons.

---

## Script 2: Ground Truth and Estimation Analysis

File:

```text
Missions/scripts/analyze_groundtruth_and_estimation.py
```

### Purpose

This script uses both:

- `vehicle_local_position_0.csv`
- `vehicle_local_position_groundtruth_0.csv`

It computes:

1. **Ground-truth path vs planned mission**
2. **Estimated path vs ground-truth path**

### Outputs

It saves:

- `run_name_groundtruth_estimation_summary.csv`
- `run_name_estimation_error_timeseries.csv`
- `run_name_estimated_vs_groundtruth_vs_planned.png`
- `run_name_groundtruth_cte_over_time.png`
- `run_name_estimation_error_over_time.png`

### Run it

```bash
python3 ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/scripts/analyze_groundtruth_and_estimation.py   ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/baseline/run_01
```

### Why it matters

This separates:

- **actual flight deviation**
- **navigation estimation error**

which is especially important for later anomaly-condition comparisons.

---

## Repeated Baseline Runs

For repeated baseline testing, use a structure like:

```text
Missions/baseline/
├── run_01/
├── run_02/
├── run_03/
├── ...
└── run_10/
```

For each run folder:

1. save the `.ulg`
2. convert it to CSV
3. run script 1
4. run script 2

This produces consistent per-run summary outputs and figures.

---

## Script 3: Aggregate Runs Within One Group

File:

```text
Missions/scripts/aggregate_run_group.py
```

### Purpose

This script aggregates repeated runs within one group, such as:

- `baseline/`
- `spoofing/`
- `dropout/`

It:

- scans all `run_*` folders in the group
- reads:
  - `*_metrics_summary.csv`
  - `*_groundtruth_estimation_summary.csv`
- combines them into one per-run table
- computes group statistics:
  - mean
  - std
  - min
  - max
  - count
- saves plots for common metrics

### Run it

For baseline:

```bash
python3 ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/scripts/aggregate_run_group.py   ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/baseline
```

For another group:

```bash
python3 ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/scripts/aggregate_run_group.py   ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/spoofing
```

### Outputs

For a group called `baseline`, this script saves:

- `baseline_combined_results.csv`
- `baseline_group_statistics.csv`
- metric plots such as:
  - `baseline_mean_cte_m_by_run.png`
  - `baseline_rms_cte_m_by_run.png`
  - `baseline_gt_mean_cte_m_by_run.png`
  - `baseline_est_gt_mean_error_m_by_run.png`

### Why it matters

This is the per-condition summary layer. It makes it possible to compare repeated runs statistically instead of analyzing only one run at a time.

---

## Script 4: Compare Multiple Groups

File:

```text
Missions/scripts/compare_multiple_groups.py
```

### Purpose

This script compares **any number of experiment groups**, not just two.

Example groups:

- `baseline`
- `spoofing`
- `dropout`
- `noise_low`
- `noise_high`
- `bias_small`
- `bias_large`

It:

- scans the parent `Missions/` folder
- finds all group folders except `scripts/`
- reads each group's:
  - `GROUPNAME_combined_results.csv`
- merges all groups into one master table
- computes statistics by group
- generates comparison plots across groups

### Run it

```bash
python3 ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions/scripts/compare_multiple_groups.py   ~/bachelor-thesis/Missions
```

### Outputs

Inside `Missions/`, it saves:

- `all_groups_combined_results.csv`
- `all_groups_statistics.csv`
- boxplots such as:
  - `mean_cte_m_boxplot.png`
  - `rms_cte_m_boxplot.png`
  - `gt_mean_cte_m_boxplot.png`
  - `est_gt_mean_error_m_boxplot.png`
- mean ± std bar charts such as:
  - `mean_cte_m_mean_std.png`
  - `rms_cte_m_mean_std.png`
  - `gt_mean_cte_m_mean_std.png`
  - `est_gt_mean_error_m_mean_std.png`

### Why it matters

This is the final comparison layer for the thesis. It makes it possible to compare multiple experiment conditions in one consistent framework.

## Short README-Style Summary

A repeatable rectangular mission was created in QGroundControl and flown in PX4/Gazebo simulation. Each run produced a PX4 `.ulg` log, which was converted into CSV files and analyzed with Python. The first script measured deviation between the estimated path and the planned rectangle. The second script added ground-truth path deviation and estimation error relative to simulator truth. Repeated runs within a single condition were aggregated with a third script, and multiple experiment groups were compared with a fourth script. This provides a complete framework for comparing nominal flights against multiple anomaly-condition experiment groups.
